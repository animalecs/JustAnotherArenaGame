# JustAnotherArenaGame

This is my first project developed in Unity 3D for my secondary school graduation project.
It's developed in Javascript and in this project I'm just sharing the code because the assets
I bought are under license.

### Assets

The 3D files and animations I used for the enemies are on the Unity Assets Store at the following links:
